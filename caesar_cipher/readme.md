## General Information
Program implements the Caesar cipher.

## Setup
The encryption idea is based on cyclically shifting letters by a specified amount. For instance, if the shift is by three positions, then the letter A becomes the letter D, B becomes E, and so on. The last three letters of the alphabet loop back to the beginning. So, the letter X becomes A, Y becomes B, and Z becomes C. Numbers, spaces, and other symbols are not encrypted.

In the program, the user will input a phrase and a shift number, after which the encrypted message should be computed.

The program will encrypt both lowercase (a-z) and uppercase letters (A-Z).
